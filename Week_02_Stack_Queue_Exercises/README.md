## Problems
**P1.** You are given a string $s$, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. We will call a "duplicate removal" the operation of selecting two adjacent and identical letters and removing them from the string. Repeat the "duplicate removal" process on $s$ until you reach a state where it can no longer be applied. Implement a function removeDuplicates that returns the string $s$ after repeatedly performing the "duplicate removal" process.
